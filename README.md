# Documentation
## Install
- Requires node.js >= 8.x
- Requires npm >= 5.x
- Requires ASW S3, to store your config file
- Requires ASW SQS, to store out of bound email messages

In the application root folder, install and run this application by the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
## Setup Environment

On your server running this application, export 2 env var: 'ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', which is used to access your
```sh
export ACCESS_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

## Usage Overview
From the client side, users should send a HTTP 'POST' with email details (like to, from, cc, bcc, subject, content) in request body which follows JSON format.

#### Request Example:

Let's use Curl command for an example in linux/unix OS

JSON BODY:
```json
{
  "to":[
          {"email":"lldylldx@gmail.com","name":"Peter Tan"},
          {"email":"Hao Tan <south.face.au@gmail.com>"}
       ],
  "cc":[{"email":"abc@test.com"}],
  "bcc":[{"email":"bcd@test.com","name":"Wei Zhao"}],
  "subject":"Hello, World! By Sendgrid!",
  "from":{"email":"The Future <future@example.com>","name":"The Future"},
  "content":[{"type":"text/plaint","value":"Hello, world from the future!"}]
}
```

Curl command:

```sh
curl -i --request POST \
--URL http://ec2-54-206-38-14.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/api/v1/mail/send
--header 'content-type: application/json'
--data 'PUT JSON BODY ABOVE Into HERE'
```

## Problems and Solutions

* **How to make the email service not block when either proxy MailGun or SendGrid email service is down?**


Initiate a scheduler to send heartbeats every 10 sec to both MailGun and SendGrid by using their test mode APIs. Based on the heartbeat checking results, a singleton class 'MailServersManager' maintains properties like Primary Server, Server Status (active ? down ?) , primary server down times, etc.

When end users try to call RESTful API to send emails, firstly, primary server should be used to send emails. If failed, primary server down time will be add 1.(When primary server down times equal '3', the scheduler should set another active mail server as the primary one and then reset the down time to 0.)

Then another active email server will then be used to send this email after primary server failed. If still fail to send email out, this request will be sent to AWS SQS and wait for another try when the email server is in service.


* **How to deal with unresponsive error?**

  * Set timer with timeout when calling async services.
  * When Node Server is overloaded (long event loop lag, intensive CPU usage > 90%), then reject the incoming requests at that moment.


* **How to reduce data loss due to everything?**

Data loss happened in different situation, for example, node server is overloaded, network issues caused data missing during transmission between different network node, slow backend with heavy traffic, etc.

There are many things can be done to reduce data loss. The solutions depend on different data loss reason. For example, heavy traffic and slow backend server can be solved by scaling up the application cluster, adding servers cluster to do load balance, adding different level of local cache or queue (in-memory or persistence into DB, file system, etc.).

To make it simple, this application use AWS SQS as a solution to avoid data loss. It detect node server status by monitoring event loop lag value. If lag > 70ms, which means CPU might be used over 90% and long queue waiting for being handled. As a single node, in this situation, it just response a server side error (503) to users without doing anything further. Data loss will happen at this stage. When lag is between 10ms and 70ms (CPU usage  between around 60% to 90%), the application will dispatch the incoming queries to AWS S3 and return success directly to users if succeeded.

At the same time, there's another child process keep running independent against the node server, which keep pulling messages from SQS queue every 10s and send emails based on that. If email is sent successfully, the message will be deleted from SQS queue, otherwise, will resend it again.

In this way, the application can handle big traffic better. Other better designed queue can be used to improve the performance as well. Cloud based application scaling tech can also be another options.

* **How to keep secrets in the black box?**

Using local config file together with other source code will cause some sensitive data is exposed to the public, which may cause potential security problems. This application will download config file from AWS S3 bucket at the beginning of initial stage. And store AWS access key onto the published server to avoid this security issue in many circumstance.

## Tests
Based on BDD/TDD, test is very important to make sure the code quality. Within this application, Mocha, Chalk, Node-Mock-Http modules are used in UT/FT/IT. CURL is also used in ST.

## ToDo List
* Dockerize this application to make it more flexible for the production deployment and scaling
* Use Kubernetes to auto deploy, scale and manage the dockerized application


## Design Optimising
* Make use of Apache Http server cluster in the first
* Optimise the child process management
* Implement an in-memory cache mechanism as the level 2 buffer when dealing with heavy traffic
* Use better performance queue instead of AWS SQS to make the application more robust and controllable
